# Deadlock State Test Input
# Circular Wait Scenario
# Expected: DEADLOCK detected

Processes: 4
Resources: 3

# No available resources - cannot satisfy any process
Available: 0 0 0

# Allocation Matrix (processes hold resources)
Allocation:
P0: 1 0 1
P1: 1 1 0
P2: 0 1 1
P3: 1 0 0

# Maximum Need Matrix (processes need more)
Maximum:
P0: 2 1 2
P1: 2 2 1
P2: 1 2 2
P3: 2 1 1

# Need Matrix (Max - Allocation)
# P0: 1 1 1 - needs resources but none available
# P1: 1 1 1 - needs resources but none available
# P2: 1 1 1 - needs resources but none available
# P3: 1 1 1 - needs resources but none available

# Analysis: All processes need at least one of each resource
# but available = [0,0,0], creating a deadlock condition
